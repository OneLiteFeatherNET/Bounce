# ðŸ§± Block Module

This module provides a collection of **block handlers** for different block types.

> [!CAUTION]
> This module is **data-only**.  
> It loads and registers block states but does **not** implement placement, interaction, or gameplay logic.  
> Such behavior must be handled in other modules.

> [!NOTE]
> This module is designed to be **extensible**.  
> Additional block handlers and state definitions can be implemented as needed, without altering the existing structure.
